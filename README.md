## Description

This is an application created from provided starter code. It's an Express-based note taking app that allows the user to write, save, and retreive notes. I fleshed out the back end and connected it with the completed front end.

The structure of the app is simple; a landing page with a start button and a notes page that allows the user to add and write new notes, save those notes, and delete existing notes.

The app can be run locally but I've also [deployed it to Heroku.](https://powerful-bastion-50177.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

To run the app on a local server, first install the dependencies with `npm i`.

Start the server with `npm start`. The default port is 3001 ([localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)).

## Usage

On the landing page, click the button that says "Get Started". This will take you the note creation page.

The left-hand column shows a list of currently saved notes. The area on the right shows the contents of the selected note or serves as the editor area for a new note.

To create a new note, click the plus sign (+) in the upper-right corner.

When a new note has both a title and content, a floppy disk icon will appear next to the plus sign. This button will allow the note to be saved, and it will appear in the saved notes list when the button is clicked.

Saved notes can be deleted by clicking the red trash can icon to the right of the saved note's title in the saved notes list.

To get back to the landing page, click the "Note Taker" text in the upper-left corner.
